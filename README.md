Repo made to help practice best practices and new features of ES6.

## What is being used for writing ES6 code
* I am using ATOM with linter-jshint to help show possible conflicts in the code.
* I am using node modules of babel e.g. `npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env`
* I am using node to run `app.js`
